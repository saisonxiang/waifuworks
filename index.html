            THE CURRENT MANIFESTO OF 𝛕𝜌å𝞈ßƒ™
        </span>
        <hr style="width:90%;height:5px;border-width:0;color:white;background-color:white">

    <br>

    So far we are at a point of continuous disintegration, distraction, and rebirth
    phases of my current life's work documentation. I find that my activities within
    the frameworks and group theory that I conduct matrix algebra within most closely
    fall under the classification that would make me the sole operator of an independently
    financed and broadly focused Non Government Organization.

    For those of you looking for a fall guy, you need look no further than my partner in crime,
    Gizmo. He meditated, orchestrated, and directed me via telepathic communication to create "the
    bookends" as he calls it. The documents to chronicle my affairs. The business end of my long
    winded asides to the State. If you need someone to cry to, he knows how to cuddle. If you want
    to unload your Desert Eagle pistol, he will take it like a champ.
    <br>
    <br>

    But if you want to rationally debate our position in the Carolinas as to how we should best
    attack the bougees and undermine the squares, you can read from out there while me and me mates
    write our memoirs of how we did it without help. How we labored at cost and found our calling with
    ladies that helped us experience love. And all while the world crumbled and bridges snapped at the
    pure weight of what we carried in our breast pockets. To write as we lived and live as we wished,
    within reason, these are the asides of our work; both free from contract that swore the other was to
    blame and without fear of unpaid tax to the sheriffs of the border. Dear Gizmo was the culprit that
    made us fight from our throats and play like we could fix us after the pigs took the sun away.

            I.
        </span>
        <br>
        <br>
        My goals:
        <br>1. to fix for the trouble.
        <br>2. to house for the needy.
        <br>3. to love our ladies over any other.
        <br>
        <br>And let the rest be figured out by Buddha's best brothers and sisters that find us when we need
        help the most. But to never write in fear. To never give in to the jokers. To always find a way to
        keep living and keep pushing the group toward a better spot where more can be free and frank.

            II.
        </span>
    </center>
    <br>
    <br>

    1. We could hold a grudge and focus every ounce of energy on revenge. Instead we will wash our hands
    often of the things that others have done in fear of our gifts. It will be better for all that we don't
    waste time on negative energy.
    <br>
    <br>
    2. I will treat every human with respect and compassion that gives me the same. For those that do not
    share my outlook, I will do my best to not give them reason to challenge my attempts to help whom I care
    about. I will not share information or resources with those that utilize violence against others to control
    them or to steal from them in my prescence or to my knowledge.
    <br>
    <br>
    3. I will work for the common good of as many groups I can stand at least within this computational framework
    I find myself in. The trees I have built were not made with premeditation or a real goal in mind but other than to
    expand and learn in cyberspace with regards to virtual reality as well as reality and what is true and can be
    measured as fact from those findings. I will maintain connections rather than disconnect at this time unless I find
    the amount of energy required is too much or that we have an impossible difference of thought.

    This NGO will, for now, operate as it always has; with the finance of the Branch estate, the
    emergency relief of my mother, father, and sisters but the brunt of the business end square on my
    shoulders. We will not bow to the demands of the State for funding and we will look for other investors
    but refuse their offerings if they demand to control the direction and purpose of this home and/or my
    personal business affairs with the community. I will work as I was trained and as the best that I can
    on the fly, as I always have. I will focus my energy on improving the living conditions for women,
    children and the elderly by what I do. I will not use a firearm to change someone's mind or to expropriate
    another. I may employ a blade; as a small tool. And at wits end, the finishing touches on someone that
    makes me fear for my life. You can consider my motives and operations to abide by the highest authority,
    Buddha. But if you need a human institution to hold accountable for my operational protocol I would say
    my duties would be best described as following the requirements of a entity that reports to the United
    Nations. In such a position I will feel obligated to immediately report any suspicion of the following
    violations:

            III.
        </span>
        <br>
        <br>
        1. to prevent, suppress, and punish trafficking of humans;
        <br>
        2. to prevent the smuggling of migrants by land, air, and sea; and
        <br>
        3. to stop the illicit manufacturing of and trafficking in firearms,
        <br>
        their parts and components, and ammunition

    <br>
    <br>
    <center><hr style="width:75%;height:5px;border-width:0;color:white;background-color:white"></center>

    I am not in the NGO business in order to buy a woman from a slave trader.
    I do not wish to trade in firearms, even legal ones. I believe, along with
    those in the UN, that these offenses are heinous and should be reported.
    <br>
    <br>

    That gets me to a point. The "demands" of this entity. Not that I feel
    as though I am afforded a place at any table currently but I have prepared
    the following demands if I am ever given the respect of being one of the parties
    considered required to manage the assignment of value in lieu of payment for
    transgressions of the State. They are as follows:
    <br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-size: 18px;">
        <center>
            <br>
            -Gun reform.
            <br>
            -Reparations for the African American community in USD
            <br>
            -Safe, sane, and consensual adult relationships (online and IRL).
            <br>
            -Declassification of the documentation regarding extra terrestrials.

            <br>
            -Abortion rights for all females regardless of how they became pregnant.
            <br>
            -Defunding of the police sector and up-cycling and re-educating officers
            <br>
            -Safe, sane, and consensual medical care for those deemed "mentally incompetent"
            <br>
            -Equal pay for equal work for all genders, races, religious groups, etc. within the United States.
            <br>
            -An end to the failure that is "the War on Drugs" and releasing non-violent drug offenders from prison.
            <br>
            -Humans taking responsibility for the effect they have on the planet and ending their reliance on non-renewables

    We will consider this a draft. Which could be cataloged under various code designations and/or
    aliasing trademarks I have developed over the years. We will settle currently on at least the name
    of the NGO. This NGO shall be considered, by the honorable council, and it's team of do-nothings
    and shout-louds, to be named the
    <span style="color:mediumvioletred;">𝛕巴ℒ∑𝜌å†Hiℂ</span>

    <span style="color:violet;">åsiÅn</span>

    <span style="color:indianred;">ßµ∂∂His†</span>
    <span style="color:lightpink;">ƒ∑∂巴®å𝛕iøN™</span> or 𝛕𝜌å𝞈ßƒ™ for short. These two depictions are hereby MINE.
    I don't care if you need documentation to prove that YOU do not have the right to pen these distinctions
    without the express written consent of this human being. Which YOU know the identity of and regularly laugh
    at his shit. If some stupid dude wants to use this he has to pay MY tax. Every time. For the rest of the game.
    Of course all waifus are afforded free and unfettered use of this shit for whatever reason they want until they
    discontinue or get bored and quit. If you are not amused by other publications I have concurrently created or
    create in the future please feel free to send butt hurt notice to any of the literal fifteen channels of
    communication we are currently working on. Again, Gizmo is the fall guy. Warranty = 0. You have been notified
    in writing of your incompetence. I have displayed a superiority in amusing myself at least.
