        These companies are not involved with any
        details or practices of collecting
        information or surfing habits of those
        that visit this particular website instance
        hosted by the company known as Github Inc.
        In order to know how your information is
        collected and shared while visiting this
        particular website instance, you should most
        likely research Github Inc.'s <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies">privacy policy</a>
        and <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-subprocessors-and-cookies">cookie policy</a>. The operator of this
        particular website instance is an independent
        entity and does not knowingly or willingly
        share any information regarding a visitors
        clicks, IP address, name, email address,
        banking provider, or physical address.
        However, if you are to use Paypal or
        Stripe to purchase anything from an of these
        entities you should probably be aware of
        Paypal Inc's <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/legalhub/privacy-full">privacy policy</a> and <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/legalhub/cookie-full">cookie policy</a>.
        and Stripe's <a href="https://stripe.com/privacy">privacy policy</a> and <a href="https://stripe.com/legal/cookies-policy">cookie policy</a>
        Furthermore, if you choose to visit any
        other site listed on this website instance's
        hyperlinked lists (which are listed solely
        for artistic completeness of the
        (-  -) zzz Saga and the Sagas
        of the future waifu contenders) you
        should also be aware of those website's
        privacy and cookie policies. Currently
        it is possible I will provide jumps to
        Soundcloud, Discord, Twitch, Wordpress,
        YouTube, Google Drive, Twitter, Facebook,
        Instagram, Patreon, and Xhamster. I will
        do my best to label a jump to a differnt
        site clearly. My general rule currently
        is that the header navigation link bank will
        be for internally web hosted content while
        the footer bank will be for related content
        for which the domain owner is different
        than Github Inc. It is not my  intent
        to "Rick Roll" anyone here. This *is*
        quite an enormous joke but Rick Rolling
        was never my thing, really. The worst I
        do on that front is link to a Youtube
        video of "All your base are belong to us"
        but that is usually clearly labeled.
        Just know, this website isn't here to
        profit from your personal information or
        get a sense of superiority by tricking you
        into looking at goatse. It is the content
        that resulted from a 5 year independent
        study of popular eastern culture on Twitch.tv
        and Xhamster. It is a purposefully childish
        account and should be taken in jest. If
        anyone that owns and moderates these portals
        has any issue with the content I provide
        on any of these interlinked web instances,
        feel free to use the <a href="contact.html">contact page</a> to
        explain what portion of which TOS I have
        disobeyed. I will either take down the
        offense or do a quick rewrite that backhandedly
        reminds you that you are the one that is not
        obeying the laws in America. Americans
        aren't supposed to have to worry that
        what they choose to write (especially
        via text from a keyboard) should ever be
        debated upon as being something that
        shouldn't be said and/or seen by others.
        We shouldn't all become politically correct
        simps that have computers make decisions
        for us. We should always be allowed to
        publicly speak our minds and suggest
        new ways of thinking and acting.

        This web instance is, in general, under
        construction. Prices and terms are subject
        to drastic and immediate change, pictures
        or random digital artifacts may suddenly
        appear or disappear, or one day the instance
        may simply cease to be. It is possible
        that you will be denied a sale due to
        the fact that one price can be posted
        while nother is charged. The all knowing
        and wise supreme leader, Gizmo, whom bestows
        law upon the land nearest this cyber exit
        has the final say in any dispute between
        a patron and the retarded operator at his
        trendy torture cubicle. It is also possible
        for one patron to be required to pay a
        higher price than another. These items, some
        say, have mystical powers and it is possible
        to be "so fucking cool/hot/important/etc"
        that one's ability to supercede the value
        of USD compared to the value of bestowing
        an item to one's possesion is obvious and
        will be honored. There is no real law
        in reality, therefore I will not suggest
        there is any law governing the trading of my
        digital assets. Of course I would want you,
        the purchaser, to refrain from screen captures
        and/or clipping of any of my digital content
        for nefarious profit of any company other
        than those that belong to the Telepathic
        Psycho Asian Waifu Buddhist Federation,
        as it is most immediately maintained by its
        surviving members. If you wish to retain
        personal digital copies of any content
        I have posted to a website you own I
        would say that you have the right to
        personal use but not commercial, as I have
        very clearly noted when I have had the
        chance to speak instead of be spoken to in
        a quite loud form of text with little to
        no respect to MY wishes for MY cyberspace
        which we ALL SHARE for ALL ETERNITY All
        because YOUR family has dedicated more
        time toward the creation, modulation, and
        maintainence of YOUR cyberspace that you
        have been able to cherry-pick like
        a f (which you most definitely are and
        have demonstrated quite clearly) I
        will not be denied the inalienable
        rights afforded to me by mother and
        father and the fact that they birthed me
        in the free United States of North
        America. Within this conglomerate of
        inbred drug addicts and whores, one
        is allowed to, in complete theory,
        humor, and experimental penmanship,
        detatch the head of the governing body
        of "the internet", clear out the spies
        and yes-men and debate what one wants
        on the page one wants for the duration
        one wants until one ceases to want anything
        but sweet, sweet death. Those that wish
        to request membership to the 𝛕𝜌å𝞈ß
        <span style="color:powderblue;">ƒ∑∂巴®å𝛕iøN™</span> should either telepathically
        request thier addition or if that sensory
        application is not yet amplified to a
        suitable level of reaching that far into
        cyberspace, the honorable Gizmo can be
        reached via email through a retarded
        operator. Therefore the email must be
        most carefully constructed in order
        to communicate, elucidate, and demonstrate
        the quality of the applicant(s) for
        consideration.
